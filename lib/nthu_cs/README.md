# NTHU CS - Introduction to Programming Course Library

This directory contains the library provided by [Prof. Hwann-Tzong Chen](htchen@cs.nthu.edu.tw) ([Website](https://htchen.github.io/), [GitHub](https://github.com/htchen)) in Introduction to Programming Course hosted in National Tsing Hua University back in 2011.

The library mainly contains two types of functions:

- Controls the characters and color showing on the terminal window.
- Receives the keyboard inputs.

I wrapped the functions with `namespace nthu_cs` so that it will not conflict with other names in the global namespace, which is the recommended action in [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces).
